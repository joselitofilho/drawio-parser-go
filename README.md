# Overview

This is a GoLang library designed to parse [draw.io](diagrams) diagram files and convert them into Go language 
structures. This project aims to provide a straightforward way to extract meaningful data from draw.io diagrams 
programmatically, enabling developers to integrate draw.io diagrams into their Go applications seamlessly.

## Key Features

1. **Draw.io File Parsing**: Implement robust parsing functionality to extract data from draw.io XML files efficiently.
1. **Conversion to Go Structures**: Transform parsed data into Go language structures for easy manipulation and integration 
into Go projects.
1. **Support for Various Diagram Elements**: Support parsing various elements commonly found in draw.io diagrams, 
including shapes, connectors, text, and metadata.

## Potential Future Enhancements

1. **Export to Other Formats**: Extend functionality to support exporting parsed diagrams to various formats, such as 
image files or other diagram formats.
